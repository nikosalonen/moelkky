## 🎮 How to Use

### Starting a Game

1. **Choose Game Mode**: Select between Individual or Team mode
2. **Add Players**: Enter player names and click "Add Player" (minimum 2 players required)
3. **Create Teams** (Team Mode): Create teams and assign players (2-4 players per team, minimum 2 teams)
4. **Reorder Team Players** (Team Mode): Use the "Reorder" button to arrange players in throwing order (mobile-optimized)
5. **Start Game**: Click "Start Game" to begin
6. **Track Scores**: Use the score input to record points for each player/team
7. **Apply Penalties**: Use the penalty button if a player/team violates rules
8. **End Game**: Click the "End Game" button to return to the start screen and reset all scores

### Team Game Flow

In team mode, the throwing order follows this pattern:
- **Round 1**: Team 1 Player 1 → Team 2 Player 1 → Team 3 Player 1 → ...
- **Round 2**: Team 1 Player 2 → Team 2 Player 2 → Team 3 Player 2 → ...
- **Round 3**: Team 1 Player 3 → Team 2 Player 3 → Team 3 Player 3 → ...
- And so on...

This ensures each team gets one throw per round, and all players within each team throw in the order you've set.

### Scoring Rules

- **Single Pin**: Score the number on the pin
- **Multiple Pins**: Score the number of pins knocked down
- **Exceeding 50**: Score resets to 25
- **Winning**: First player/team to reach exactly 50 points wins
- **Consecutive Misses**: 
  - **Individual Mode**: Players are eliminated after 3 consecutive zero-point turns
  - **Team Mode**: Teams are eliminated after 3 consecutive zero-point turns

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with UI

### Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests using Vitest and Testing Library:

```bash
npm test
```

Tests cover:
- Component functionality
- Game logic and state management
- User interactions
- Error handling

#### E2E Testing

The project also includes end-to-end tests using Playwright:

```bash
# Run e2e tests (recommended - automatically manages dev server)
npm run test:e2e

# Run e2e tests with headed browser
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Run e2e tests in debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Run e2e tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run e2e tests with built-in server (may hang)
npm run test:e2e:with-server

# View e2e test reports
npm run test:e2e:report
```

**Note**: The default `test:e2e` command uses a custom script that automatically starts and stops the development server, preventing the hanging issue that can occur with the built-in webServer option.
