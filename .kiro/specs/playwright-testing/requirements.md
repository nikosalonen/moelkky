# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves implementing Playwright for end-to-end testing in the application. Playwright will provide comprehensive browser automation testing capabilities, allowing us to test user interactions, UI components, and application workflows across different browsers. This will enhance our testing strategy by adding robust end-to-end test coverage alongside our existing unit and integration tests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up Playwright testing framework, so that I can write and run end-to-end tests for the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is configured THEN Playwright SHALL be installed and configured as a development dependency
2. WHEN Playwright is set up THEN the system SHALL include configuration files for test execution
3. WHEN Playwright is configured THEN the system SHALL support testing across multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
4. WHEN tests are executed THEN Playwright SHALL generate test reports and screenshots on failures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to write Playwright tests for critical user flows, so that I can ensure the application works correctly from an end-user perspective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN the system SHALL provide test utilities and page object patterns for maintainable test code
2. WHEN testing user flows THEN tests SHALL cover navigation, form interactions, and state changes
3. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL validate UI elements, content, and user interactions
4. WHEN tests execute THEN they SHALL run in headless mode by default with option for headed mode during development

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Playwright tests integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, so that end-to-end tests run automatically on code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed THEN Playwright tests SHALL run as part of the automated testing suite
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and failure artifacts
3. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL allow the build process to continue
4. WHEN running in CI THEN tests SHALL execute efficiently with appropriate timeouts and retry logic

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the MÃ¶lkky score counter functionality with Playwright, so that I can ensure the scoring system works correctly in a real browser environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the score counter THEN tests SHALL verify player addition and removal functionality
2. WHEN testing scoring THEN tests SHALL validate score input, calculation, and display
3. WHEN testing game flow THEN tests SHALL verify game state transitions and winner determination
4. WHEN testing UI interactions THEN tests SHALL ensure responsive behavior and accessibility features work correctly
